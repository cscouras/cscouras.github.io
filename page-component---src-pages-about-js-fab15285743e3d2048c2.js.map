In building my React applications I've set up my development environment\n        with Webpack and manually configured Sass and Babel loaders, though I've learned that create-react-app\n        can be a wonderful tool when I just want to get started. I do my best to keep up with the always changing\n        web development landscape. Recently I've been looking into CSS Grid and how I can implement it when considering\n        layout for my projects. I am familiar with version control software, I have used Mercurial in the past\n        and am using git and GitHub to manage my current projects.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n         If you'd like to reach out please feel free to <Link to=\"/contact\">contact me</Link>.\n      </p>\n      <img src={cert} alt=\"FCC Front End Certification\" className=\"cert\"/>\n\n    </section>\n\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default About\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/pages/about.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
